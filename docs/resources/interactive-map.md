# TRP Interactive Map

The **[Terra Isles Interactive Crime Map](https://map.terra-isles.com/)** is an interactive map that allows for easy viewing of postals, in-game coordinates, key locations, active calls, and historic calls in one simple interface.

## The Interface

![TRP Interactive Map](/img/map/Map.png)

The TRP Interactive Crime Map uses the default Leaflet interface with some modifications by the Department of Development (DoD) Team.

Every 5 Minutes (unless [disabled](#Settings)) the active call data will refresh which will show a loading screen until this process is completed. When the loading screen is shown all UI elements are unclickable. This process usually only takes a second or two.

## Layers

Layers can be accessed in the top-right corner of the interface.

There are two kinds of layers **base maps** and **overlays**.
By default the following layers on enabled:
* Hybrid Base Map
* Postals
* Road Signs
* Locations
* Active Calls

In the menu you can enable or disable any overlay you wish and switch to any base map you prefer. 

<sub>*Note: These settings will reset to the default if you leave or refresh the page.*</sub>

## Legend

To access the icon legend, simply click the<box-icon class='inline' name='list-ul' color='var(--box-icon-color)'></box-icon>icon on the left to show/hide it.

Once in the settings menu you can view the time left until the next data refresh, enable/disable auto refreshing, select which server to pull data from (*default is **Server 1***), and enable/disable the Coordinate Probe (*to be added in version 1.0.7*).

## Live Map (CAD)

Dispatchers have access to a different version of the Crime Map which includes current unit locations to aid in dispatching nearby units to a call. 

Dispatchers can access this special version of the Crime Map through **Live Map** button on their CAD System. You will need to login with Discord before you can view the map.

Unit locations is currently only updated every 5 Minutes. *(Subject to change)*
