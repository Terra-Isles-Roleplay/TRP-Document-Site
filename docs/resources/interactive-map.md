# TRP Interactive Map

The **[Terra Isles Interactive Crime Map](https://map.terra-isles.com/)** is an interactive map that allows for easy viewing of postals, in-game coordinates, key locations, active calls, and historic calls in one simple interface.

## The Interface

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
