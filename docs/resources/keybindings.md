# Key Bindings

There are a variety of key bindings that can be configured in FiveM. To configure your key bindings to how you like, or to view the current key bindings, open the **Pause Menu** while in the server and navigate to **Settings**. Then scroll down to **Key Bindings** and press :enter: (:A: / :X:) to enter the Key Bindings menu. From there scroll down to **FiveM** and hit :enter: (:A: / :X:) again. From there you can change any key bingins you want by scrolling to the key binding you want and selecting it. Then just press the key you wish to replace the default with.

## Default Key Bindings

This is a list of all the default key bindings used in the TRP FiveM Servers.
