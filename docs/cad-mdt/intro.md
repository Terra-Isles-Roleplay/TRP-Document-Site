# Introduction

Terra Isles Roleplay utilizes a custom built <u>Computer Aided Dispatch</u> *(CAD)* and <u>Mobile Data Terminal</u> *(MDT)* system for a variety of things such as call creation and management, civilian creation and management, dispatching, and reports.

## Logging in

To log in to the CAD/MDT, first go to **[CAD/MDT](https://cad.terra-isles.com/)** where you should see the login screen.

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
